# ManageMe

Every contemporary person lives in a building nowadays. The people who do not live in buildings are a minority even in third world countries. So, the real question is the following: Do you suffer from organizing your bills? Do you fear from getting tricked with the bill of a previous month? Do you get lost in organizing where your money has been spent or where you should spend it? In that case, do you find it hard to remember who paid what? Hereâ€™s the thing, computers nowadays do lots of things for us. So why bother trying to remember everything when a computer can do it for you? We have taken it upon ourselves to create a software that will help you organize all these things in a click of a button. All you have to do is download the app (on Android or IOS), register your building, and add your tenants to get a mind free from all this headache of organizing the bills.
